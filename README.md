# LSTMusic
A 3-person school project for Music generation using neural networks. 

We use the Maestro dataset (https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro), which contains 200 hours of classical piano. 

The model is an LSTM model, using keras.

The datasets are not present here because of their size.
There is also the project report that will help you understand how we came up with our results named Projet_S7___Musique_par_Reseau_de_Neurones.

In the folder Resultats, you will find the final results of our predictions, but also the intermediate results that we obtained using 5% and 10%of our database (in the formatNAME_FILE5 or NAME_FILE10) and also the different graphs that we produced (ImagesEntrainement).
